# LCA4DH  
### A Life Cycle Assessment data-driven tool for the evaluation of district heating and cooling networks  

**“Measuring today, designing a sustainable heat for tomorrow.”**

## Synthetic Description  
The authors developed and provided a computational code delivered as an open-source tool written in **Python**.  
The tool allows **energy utility companies** operating in the **District Heating and Cooling (DHC)** sector — as well as other stakeholders — to evaluate the **environmental profile** of the thermal energy supplied to buildings by district networks in an **automated and standardized** way, fully compliant with the requirements of the new **Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD, version 4)**.  

The tool integrates **Brightway2.5** as its core computational engine for **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**.
